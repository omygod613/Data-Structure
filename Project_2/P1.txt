1. 
No, the current _dynArrSetCapacity does not have a resizing function, so if we want to resize a smaller capacity, we should add a if(v->size < v->capacity) into removeAtDynArr.


2. 
The removeAtDynArr should be modified because the current dynamic array only can resized to a bigger capacity. So if we want to resize it to a smaller capacity, we should add a if (v->size < v->capacity) into removeAtDynArr.

(1) The thought process in the programming is hard to understand and modify. The programmer needs to take a lot of time to get used to it.

(2) It is very hard to create and debug a new program because it is hard to modify the encapsulation.
